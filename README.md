# SystemInfoApi

This project in its first phase, will be able to return the metrics of both CPU, Memory and Disks for a Linux system (Debian, Ubuntu, Redhat, etc.).

In its second phase, the project will be able to keep the history of the metrics in a Database, with the aim of making reports and graphs of said historical data.

Thanks to this author (see link) which is the base for this project:
